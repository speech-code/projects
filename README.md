# Sample Projects built by speech

This repository contains small sample projects created by _speech cli_.

- The projects live in top-level folders like `flask_instagram_clone` and `my_todo_project`.
- The `playground` folder is where a project is first built and experimented on.
  Once a project is ready, it is moved out of `playground` into its designated folder.

Each project may include its own README or run instructions; check the project folder for details.

This README is intentionally short and simple.
